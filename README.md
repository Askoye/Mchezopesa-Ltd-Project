#### *by Ted Askoye Samuel*

## Overview 
The task at hand is to create a model that can be able to undertake the prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training) using two possible approaches (as  shown below) given the datasets provided

Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)

### Approach 1: Polynomial approach

What to train given:

* Rank of home team
* Rank of away team
* Tournament type
* Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.
* Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

### Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)

## Context
